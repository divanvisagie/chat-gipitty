# Release Notes for 0.4.0

## Features
- **Web Search Functionality**: Added support for the `/search` command in user messages. When used, the app will switch to the `gpt-4o-search-preview` model and enable web search options.
- **Custom API Endpoint Support**: Added support for specifying a custom API endpoint via the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable. This enables compatibility with local and alternative LLMs by pointing the client to a custom server, such as Ollama. Improved error handling—users now receive more informative messages on request failures.

## Fixes
- **Custom API URL Fix**: Ensured custom API base URLs do not include `'/chat/completions'` by always appending `'/v1/chat/completions'` to the base URL. This solves URL construction issues for custom servers.
- **Gemini Compatibility**: Made `id` and `object` fields in `ChatResponse` optional to support Gemini model responses. Improved error reporting on parsing failures.

## Maintenance
- Optimized and updated logo assets; removed duplicates and resized logo for consistency.

## Usage

If you’d like to test with your own model (e.g., a local instance or third-party API), simply set the new `OPENAI_BASE_URL` before running `cgip`.

```sh
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```
