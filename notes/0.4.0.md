# Release Notes for 0.4.0

## Features
- **Web Search Functionality**: Added support for the `/search` command in user messages. When used with GPT models, the app will switch to the `gpt-4o-search-preview` model and enable web search options. For non-GPT models, it will keep the configured model and only add web search options.
- **Custom API Endpoint Support**: Added support for specifying a custom API endpoint via the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable. This enables compatibility with local and alternative LLMs by pointing the client to a custom server, such as Ollama. Improved error handling—users now receive more informative messages on request failures.

## Breaking Changes
- **Environment Variable Migration**: `OPENAI_API_URL` has been replaced with `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. The format has also changed:
  - **Old**: `OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` (full endpoint URL)
  - **New**: `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com` (base URL only, `/v1/chat/completions` is automatically appended)
  
  **Migration**: If you were using `OPENAI_API_URL`, update your environment variable to `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and remove the `/v1/chat/completions` suffix.

## Fixes
- **Intelligent URL Construction**: Enhanced API endpoint construction to handle various URL formats intelligently. The system now:
  - Uses URLs with existing `/chat/completions` endpoints as-is
  - Appends `/chat/completions` to URLs ending with version patterns (`/v1`, `/v1beta`, `/v2`)
  - Defaults to `/v1/chat/completions` for standard OpenAI-style base URLs
  - This solves URL construction issues for diverse API providers while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Gemini Compatibility**: Made `id` and `object` fields in `ChatResponse` optional to support Gemini model responses. Improved error reporting on parsing failures.

## Maintenance
- Optimized and updated logo assets; removed duplicates and resized logo for consistency.

## Usage

If you’d like to test with your own model (e.g., a local instance or third-party API), simply set the new `OPENAI_BASE_URL` before running `cgip`.

```sh
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```
