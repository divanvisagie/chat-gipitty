## v0.3 Release Notes

### New Features

- **Custom API Endpoint Support**
  - Add support for specifying a custom API endpoint via the `OPENAI_API_URL` environment variable.
  - Enables compatibility with local and alternative LLMs, such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com), by pointing the client to a custom server.
  - Improved error handling—users now receive more informative messages on request failures.

- **'jarjar' Option Added**
  - Introduce a new `jarjar` configuration option and associated functionality, allowing users to customize or interact with new prompt styles.


**Upgrade Note:**  
If you’d like to test with your own model (e.g., a local instance or third-party API), simply set the new `OPENAI_API_URL` before running `cgip`.

```sh
export OPENAI_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```
