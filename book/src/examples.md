# Examples

This section provides practical examples of using Chat GipiTTY in real-world scenarios. These examples demonstrate the versatility and power of integrating AI assistance into your terminal workflow.

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic Debugging
Debug a Rust program that doesn't compile:

```sh
cargo build 2>&1 | cgip "give me a short summary of the kind of error this is"
```

Result:
```sh
❯ cargo build 2>&1 | cgip 'give me a short summary of the kind of error this is'
The error you're encountering is a **lifetime error** in Rust, specifically an issue with **borrowed values not living long enough**.
```

### Code Conversion
Convert code from one language to another:

```sh
cgip "convert this to python" -f src/main.rs
```

## Development Workflow Examples

### Git Analysis
```sh
# Summarize recent commits
git log --oneline -10 | cgip "summarize these recent changes"

# Analyze a specific commit
git show HEAD | cgip "explain what this commit does"

# Review staged changes
git diff --cached | cgip "review these changes for potential issues"
```

### Code Review
```sh
# Review a specific file
cgip "review this code for bugs and improvements" -f utils.py

# Analyze function complexity
cgip "is this function too complex?" -f complex_function.js

# Check for security issues
cgip "are there any security concerns in this code?" -f auth.py
```

### Testing and Debugging
```sh
# Understand test failures
npm test 2>&1 | cgip "why are these tests failing?"

# Debug performance issues
perf record -g ./my_program && perf report | cgip "what's causing the performance bottleneck?"

# Analyze memory usage
valgrind ./my_program 2>&1 | cgip "are there memory leaks?"
```

## System Administration Examples

### Log Analysis
```sh
# Analyze system logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/syslog | cgip "are there any critical issues?"

# Web server log analysis
tail -500 /var/log/nginx/access.log | cgip "what are the most common requests?"

# Application error analysis
grep ERROR /var/log/app.log | cgip "categorize these errors"
```

### System Monitoring
```sh
# Check system resources
top -b -n 1 | cgip "which processes are consuming the most resources?"

# Disk usage analysis
df -h | cgip "do I have any disk space issues?"

# Network analysis
netstat -tuln | cgip "what services are running and are any ports concerning?"
```

### Configuration Review
```sh
# Check configuration files
cgip "review this configuration for best practices" -f /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Analyze system settings
sysctl -a | grep net | cgip "review these network settings"
```

## Data Processing Examples

### CSV Analysis
```sh
# Basic data analysis
head -20 sales_data.csv | cgip "what patterns do you see in this sales data?"

# Calculate statistics
cgip "calculate the average and median from this data" -f numbers.csv

# Data validation
cgip "check this CSV for data quality issues" -f messy_data.csv
```

### JSON Processing
```sh
# Pretty print and explain JSON
curl -s https://api.github.com/users/octocat | cgip "explain this JSON structure"

# Validate JSON structure
cgip "is this valid JSON and what could be improved?" -f config.json
```

### Text Processing
```sh
# Summarize long documents
cgip "provide a 3-sentence summary" -f long_report.md

# Extract key information
cgip "extract all email addresses and phone numbers" -f contact_list.txt

# Format conversion
cgip "convert this to markdown table format" -f data.txt
```

## Multi-modal Examples

### Image Analysis
```sh
# Analyze screenshots
cgip image --file error_screenshot.png "what error is shown and how to fix it?"

# Extract text from images
cgip image --file receipt.jpg "extract all text and format as a list"

# Diagram analysis
cgip image --file architecture.png "explain this system architecture"
```

### Voice Synthesis
```sh
# Convert text to speech
echo "Important announcement" | cgip tts --voice nova --output announcement.mp3

# Read file contents aloud
cgip tts --voice echo "reading the README file" -f README.md --output readme_audio.mp3
```

## Advanced Workflow Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```sh
# Analyze build failures
jenkins_build_log.txt | cgip "why did this build fail and how to fix it?"

# Review deployment logs
kubectl logs deployment/myapp | cgip "are there any deployment issues?"
```

### Database Administration
```sh
# Analyze slow queries
cgip "optimize this SQL query" -f slow_query.sql

# Review database logs
tail -200 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log | cgip "any database performance issues?"
```

### Security Analysis
```sh
# Analyze access logs for suspicious activity
tail -1000 /var/log/auth.log | cgip "any suspicious login attempts?"

# Review firewall rules
iptables -L | cgip "review these firewall rules for security"

# Scan for vulnerabilities
nmap localhost | cgip "analyze these open ports for security risks"
```

## Creative and Productivity Examples

### Documentation Generation
```sh
# Generate API documentation
cgip "create API documentation for these functions" -f api_handlers.py

# Write README sections
cgip "write a usage section for this tool" -f main.py

# Create changelog entries
git log --oneline v1.0..HEAD | cgip "create changelog entries for these commits"
```

### Learning and Exploration
```sh
# Understand new codebases
find . -name "*.py" | head -5 | xargs cat | cgip "explain the structure of this Python project"

# Learn from examples
cgip "explain how this algorithm works" -f sorting_algorithm.c

# Get coding help
cgip "show me how to implement a REST API client in Python"
```

### Content Creation
```sh
# Generate commit messages
git diff --cached | cgip "write a concise commit message for these changes"

# Create shell scripts
cgip "write a bash script to backup these directories" -f directory_list.txt

# Generate test cases
cgip "create unit tests for this function" -f my_function.py
```

## Integration Examples

### With Other Tools
```sh
# Combine with grep
grep -r "TODO" src/ | cgip "prioritize these TODO items"

# Combine with find
find . -name "*.log" -mtime -1 | xargs cat | cgip "summarize today's log activity"

# Combine with curl
curl -s https://api.weather.com/current | cgip "what's the weather forecast?"
```

### Pipeline Compositions
```sh
# Complex analysis pipeline
ps aux | grep python | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I {} lsof -p {} | cgip "what files are these Python processes using?"

# Multi-step data processing
cat raw_data.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | cgip "what are the most common entries?"
```

These examples showcase the flexibility of Chat GipiTTY in various contexts. The key is to think of it as a smart filter or analyzer that can be inserted into any part of your workflow where you need AI assistance.
