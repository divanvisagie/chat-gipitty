cgip is a command-line tool that leverages OpenAI's models to address and 
respond to user queries. It compiles context for these queries by prioritizing 
input in a specific order: stdin, command-line arguments, and then files which 
require you using the -f flag. 

The config file will be located in your config directory under cgip/config.toml.
Please edit this file or use `cgip config --set key=value` to set your configuration.

Usage examples:
- To pipe input in from ls, run `ls | cgip "what can you tell me about these files?"`
  This will pipe the output of ls in as the first bit of context and then add the user
  query to the context.
