Queries can be piped in through stdin and will be added to the context
first. 

The query passed in as the first argument will then be added to the context
second.

Files read using -f will be added last to the context.

Usage examples:
- To pipe input in from ls, run `ls | cgip "what can you tell me about these files?"`
  This will pipe the output of ls in as the first bit of context and then add the user
  query to the context.

More detailed information can go here.
